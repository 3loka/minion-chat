# India Engineering Workshop
This repository aims to help the developer community become familiar with the HashiStack. The workshop is structured into several phases, each introducing a HashiCorp product designed to address specific challenges in distributed systems. These phases are organized sequentially within the repository, with each phase contained in its own folder. Every phase includes a README.md file that outlines the problem being addressed and highlights the remaining challenges to be tackled in subsequent phases.

The primary goal of this workshop is to equip developers with the knowledge of when and how to effectively use these tools.
